# bike_sharing_demand
Bike sharing demand (Machine Learning)

This Python code (in a Jupiter notebook) is seen as one of the machine learning approaches in the dataset for predicting bike rental demand.
This problem can be found on Kaggle. The solution is the simplest, but effective.

In this solution, 2 models are presented: DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor
Mean_squared_log_error was chosen as an estimate of the quality of the model

This code with the launch of the program - main_book.ipynb
